Hi there! I am a senior consultant working in business & tax advisory for Liston Newton Advisory, based in Malvern, Australia. One of my areas of expertise is small business tax advisory, ensuring business owners who may not be aware of the plethora of tax obligations they must comply with remain on top of these obligations, with a focus on developing their understanding to reduce their reliance on outside guidance. 

Hand in hand with this is my specialty in business advisory in the small to medium business space, ensuring owners can understand and get the most out of their numbers by developing appropriate finance management, reporting, and forecasting procedures to allow owners to not only understand where their business is at, but where it can be and will be in 12+ months time. 

My remaining specialties are in the provision of specialist tax advice across all aspects of Australian tax law, and in the creation of financial models with complex custom drivers to accurately forecast future business performance.

Outside of work, I have an interest in analog photography - please feel free to take a look at my gallery on this page (WIP).

I keep fit by training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, which I personally consider to be the most fun you can have with your friends (and apparently it counts as cardio? Pretty cool if you ask me!).

Additionally, I have developed a more recent interest in coding - you can read more about that, you guessed it, under the coding tab here.

Feel free to reach out to me if it sounds like I can help you with something, or just if you'd like to chat! Cheers.
