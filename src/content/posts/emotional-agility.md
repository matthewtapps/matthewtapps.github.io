## Emotional Agility
[Emotional Agility](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209485-emotional-agility) is a self-help novel written by psychologist Dr. Susan David that covers _"the counterintuitive approach to achieving your true potential"_. I understand that Dr. David wrote it after the popularity of her [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2013/11/emotional-agility) of the same name. I highly recommend anyone reading this, to pause for a sec and read that article, as it is a better summary of the concepts of Emotional Agility than I can hope to write.

Over the past year or so I have read the following books (in addition to Emotional Agility) that contributed to what feels like a fundamental mindset shift in how I view my emotions and my capabilities:

- [Flow](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/66354.Flow) by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
- [Drive]() by Daniel H. Pink
- [To Sell Is Human](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13593553-to-sell-is-human) also by Daniel H. Pink
- [Influence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815.Influence) by Robert B. Cialdini
- [How Minds Change](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57933312-how-minds-change) by Daniel McRaney
- [Never Split The Difference](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123857637-never-split-the-difference) by Christopher Voss and Tahl Raz

It's certainly not necessary to have read all of these to get value out of Emotional Agility, but reading Emotional Agility felt to me like a highlight reel of content in these books in the best way possible, tying the concepts together and building on them in a very useful way.

The key concept of Emotional Agility for those haven't read it, is best described in Viktor E. Frankl's words (who is the author of [Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning), a psychologist, and a holocaust concentration camp survivor): _"Between stimulus and response there is space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response is our growth and freedom."_ Our brains develop to make sense out of the unending stream of data that our senses collect, so that we can react to that data appropriately. At a base level, we need to react to this data to survive - avoid dangers in our environment, meet our needs to live, and hopefully procreate. The animal instinct that let us with the early evolutionary competition still exists in us, in our muscle memory and our immediate emotional responses to stimuli - our brains are cognitively lazy, because if we had to thoughtfully assess every piece of data our senses collected, we'd never get anything done and would have lost the evolutionary battle long before forming a society.

But just because our automatic responses to stimuli are happening, doesn't mean we need to listen to those responses. Emotional Agility is recognising that our muscle memory and emotional responses are there for some purposes that was at some point helpful to us, but that doesn't mean that they are helpful to us now, or in every situation. By taking that space between stimulus and response and thoughtfully choosing to act in favour of our values, inner turmoil can be reduced and we can iteratively move towards the life we'd like to live based on those values.

A discrete example I have of applying this is recently I noticed my emotions seeming to "spiral" after a relatively innocuous comment a mentor of mine made during a book club session. e
