- Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
- Humans have 128 "bits" of attention per second
- Studies show that we feel happiest when we are able to dedicate these bits of attention towards something challenging
    - The challenge we dedicate our attention to is arbitrary and can be completely fabricated, the important part is having a set of constraints to test our behaviour against and expand our capabilities within through experimentation and feedback loops
- Attention is also obviously directly related to our economic and social output in life
- Despite the importance of our attention, we do not treat it as sacred
- Social media companies mine our attention for profit - their recommendation algorithms are trained under a system that prioritises keeping our attention on their platform as frequently and for as long as possible, because their main incentive is to generate profit, and that is their main method of doing so
- It would not be a novel thing for humankind to collectively decide that something is too sacred for us to continue developing: In the 90s we were [cloning sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_(sheep)) and conducting other genetic experimentation, but despite the potential application of genetic engineering in humans to increase odds of a child's having a high quality of life and/or favourable genetic traits, [the large majority of people hold the belief that this would be going too far](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/03/17/americans-are-closely-divided-over-editing-a-babys-genes-to-reduce-serious-health-risk/). I don't have an opinion on that topic that is relevant to my point for this article - the point being, it's not a new idea that some things are too sacred for us to let people manipulate freely, so why do we let social media companies freely manipulate our attention for their own gain?
- Our attention is sacred. It is what we use to interact with the world around us. Every enjoyable experience we ever have comes through the effective application of our attention against a challenge (differentiating here between enjoyment and simple pleasure, which is a physiological response to some stimuli - enjoyment is not always immediately pleasurable, but it does provide us with longer-lasting happiness and personal growth). So let's regulate how social media companies can mine that sacred resource for profit.
