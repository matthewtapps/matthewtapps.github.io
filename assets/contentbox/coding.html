I've always been interested in coding, however I officially started my coding journey at the start of April, 2023, when after some brief exposure to M Language in Power BI I asked myself - why don't I just go and learn a programming language?

I spent the next month or so smashing out 75% of the book <span style='font-variation-settings: "ital" 1'>Learn To Code By Solving Problems: A Python Programming Primer</span>, by Daniel Zingaro. I got absolutely hooked on solving the competition coding problems in this book, finding coding to be extremely engaging as it actives that problem solving area in my brain so well.

After the aforementioned 75% of the textbook, I eventually ran out of steam with coding problems and decided to tackle a project I had in mind - creating a scorekeeping and timing app for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu matches (an idea I had while helping to run an in-house competition). After a lot of learning I had a functioning Windows application with a Tkinter ui, written entirely in Python.

The next question I asked myself was "If I was going to use this in the real world, it would be on my phone. How do I do that with my code?" This turned out to be a bigger question than I thought, and the solution involved me learning to code in Kotlin (and with it, getting familiar with Android Studio and Android development in general). But I ended with a successful app running on my phone.

My next project after this was a game that I have called "Splonch" - modelled after a browser-based mobile game I saw my girlfriend playing, which upon seeing I said "I could make that as an app.", followed with "How would I make that as an app?" Eventually, Splonch was born.

The project after this was an app to calculate the CGT implications under Australian tax law, based on the user's input of an indvidual's purchases and sales (and other associated share/option trading activity). This was similarly inspired by a task I had to do manually, resulting in me asking myself "How would I do this with code?"

My most recent project is this website. After being dissatisfied with the available templating options and some brief learning on hosting websites with multiple endpoints using Flask as a backend, I decided to create my own site and use it as an excuse to learn HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, which also allowed me to customise the site as I saw fit. (Getting the triangle for the speech box moving took 3.5 hours - but very fun!).

Looking forward to the next project!
