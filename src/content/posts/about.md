## Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm Matt, a consultant software engineer working for [Midnyte City](https://midnytecity.com.au) out of Melbourne, Australia.

I am passionate about ethical technology - more specifically, I am passionate about the harms that under- or un-regulated technology are causing to society, and would love to see them be better addressed.

The key areas of technology that I see causing harm to society are:
- Social media (in particular recommendation algorithms)
- Gambling
- Unrestrained AI development

This blog is for me to ramble about the above, and whatever else I find interesting while I'm at it.

Thanks for coming.
