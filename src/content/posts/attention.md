title: "Attention: Humanity's Over-extracted, Sacred Resource"
description: "Social media companies have gotten away with mining our attention for too long."

- Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
- Humans have 128 "bits" of attention per second
- Studies show that we feel happiest when we are able to dedicate these bits of attention towards something challenging
    - The challenge we dedicate our attention to is arbitrary and can be completely fabricated, the important part is having a set of constraints to test our behaviour against and expand our capabilities within through experimentation and feedback loops
- Attention is also obviously directly related to our economic and social output in life
- Despite the importance of our attention, we do not treat it as sacred
- Social media companies mine our attention for profit - their recommendation algorithms are trained under a system that prioritises keeping our attention on their platform as frequently and for as long as possible, because their main incentive is to generate profit, and that is their main method of doing so
- It would not be a novel thing for humankind to collectively decide that something is too sacred for us to continue developing: In the 90s we were [cloning sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_(sheep)) and conducting other genetic experimentation, but despite the potential application of genetic engineering in humans to increase odds of a child's having a high quality of life and/or favourable genetic traits, [the large majority of people hold the belief that this would be going too far](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/03/17/americans-are-closely-divided-over-editing-a-babys-genes-to-reduce-serious-health-risk/). I don't have an opinion on that topic that is relevant to my point for this article - the point being, it's not a new idea that some things are too sacred for us to let people manipulate freely, so why do we let social media companies freely manipulate our attention for their own gain?
- Our attention is sacred. It is what we use to interact with the world around us. Every enjoyable experience we ever have comes through the effective application of our attention against a challenge (differentiating here between enjoyment and simple pleasure, which is a physiological response to some stimuli - enjoyment is not always immediately pleasurable, but it does provide us with longer-lasting happiness and personal growth). So let's regulate how social media companies can mine that sacred resource for profit.

I have the impression, especially recently, that more and more people agree with my belief that _something_ needs to change about social media and how humankind interacts with it. "Doom scrolling" is a common term that even my parents understand - we're becoming increasingly aware and disgusted by the drain on our brains that social media is.

Despite this, I also have the impression that we are unmotivated to do anything about it - maybe because it seems like a losing battle, like we don't know where to even start.

## Attention
Drawing on the concepts summarised excellently by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his book [Flow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow), I have been developing a mental model on how human attention works, its relationship to happiness, and how that might apply to help shift our thinking on social media.

Csikszentmihalyi defines flow as:
> The state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.

If I could guess, I would say that most people reading this can empathise with that description of flow, and have felt it before at some point in their lives. Distractions fade away, and our attention is wholly occupied with the task at hand, where we are operating within a set of constraints and getting feedback on our behaviours in a way that lets us quickly iterate and strive for completing the task to the best of our capabilities, which expand in response to our efforts.

I would also hazard a guess to say that no one reading this would say they have experienced a flow state while scrolling on social media. If you're anything like me, you would probably empathise with my experience, which is effectively the opposite of flow: I am fully aware that I am mindlessly doom scrolling while doing so, and feel powerless to stop, all the while feeling almost as miserable as I can get.

Humankind is, by design, cognitively lazy. We have big brains, and they take a lot of power to operate. Evolutionarily, it makes sense that whenever it is possible to rest and do nothing, we will choose to do that, regardless of how it makes us feel in the long run.

So when social media companies are [incentivized](/posts/social-media-and-incentives) to train their recommendation algorithms to maximise the amount of attention we spend on their platforms, it naturally follows that these algorithms evolve to hack our biology and provide easy access to dopamine to our primitive brains.

## Measuring Attention
Csikszentmihalyi states that a human is capable of processing 128 "bits" of information per second - 128 units of attention. Listening in a conversation takes 40 or so bits per second, with the remaining bits likely spent processing the information being listened to in greater detail, making connections, and figuring out what next to say.

Based on this measure, we can extrapolate a great many things, for example:
- If being productive at my job requires all 128 bits per second, you calculate how much my employer pays me per bit of attention.
- This could also be used to calculate the profit I generate for my employer per bit of attention.
- If I get distracted and look at social media while at work, based on the above measures, you could calculate the economic impact of the attention that has been robbed from me and my employer.
